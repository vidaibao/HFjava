## Overview

This tutorial project walks you through the process of creating a classic Dot Com Game. The game involves guessing the location of hidden Dot Coms on a grid. It's a fun way to learn basic programming concepts and logic.

## Features

- **Grid Setup:** Create a grid to represent the playing area.
- **Dot Com Placement:** Randomly place Dot Coms on the grid.
- **User Interaction:** Allow users to guess the locations of Dot Coms.
- **Game Logic:** Implement the logic for checking hits and misses.
- **Game Over:** Display the game's outcome and allow for replay.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Dot Com Game on your local machine. Make sure you have the prerequisites installed.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/vidaibao/HFjava.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Compile and run the main class to start the game.

## Game Rules

The rules of the Dot Com Game are simple:

1. The game is played on a virtual grid.
2. Dot Coms are randomly placed on the grid.
3. Players guess coordinates to hit Dot Coms.
4. The game ends when all Dot Coms are killed.
